# Navigating APIs with R: An Introductory Overview

## Overview

This repository contains the code and presentation slides for the "API Talk with R" session presented at the [adminR autumn 2023 meetup](https://www.meetup.com/adminr/events/296988080/). The talk is designed for R programmers who want to learn about interacting with APIs using the R programming language.

## Talk Contents

- **Slides:** The presentation slides cover the basics of APIs, how to interact with them using R, and their role in data science. Concrete examples are explored, including projects from Agroscope.

- **Code:** The repository includes code snippets and examples used during the talk. These can serve as a reference for implementing API interactions in R.

## Key Topics Covered

- Understanding what APIs are
- Introduction to REST APIs
- Use cases applicable to data science
- How to use an API with R

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Slides:** Review the presentation slides in the "slides" directory. They provide visual aid and context for the talk.

2. **Code Examples:** Explore the "code" directory for R code examples demonstrated during the talk. These examples illustrate key concepts discussed.

## Running the Code 

1. Ensure you have the required R packages installed. You can do this by running:

   ```R
   install.packages(c("httr2", "jsonlite", "purrr", "devtools", "tibblify"))
   ```
2. Open the R scripts in the "code" directory using your preferred R environment (e.g., RStudio).
3. Run the code snippets to observe the interactions with APIs. If you would like to run Cytoscape please see the link below on how to install the program.
